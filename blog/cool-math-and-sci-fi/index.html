    I'm kinda worried that I'm writing too many bits to my hard disk, I don't
    want to wear it out too soon. I've programmed a thing to generate these
    pages for me, but right now it rewrites every single page in the website.
    So. Hopefully soon, I'll probably try to update it so that I can specify
    which file I want to update. Shooouldn't be incredibly hard.
</p>

<p>Anyways, I want to talk about cool math and sci-fi themed stuff today.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/OI-To1eUtuU">turning a sphere inside out</a>
    <br />
    I find the concept of obscure and seemingly random math things really funny.
    Like, I understand that this probably has some important application but.
    It's just funny to me, the image I have in my head of a bunch of esteemed
    mathematicians getting together, all formal-like, to just invert a sphere.
    Some other funny things from this genre of random math stuff are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem">
            the hairy ball theorem
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        ok I just realized that all kinds of media where there seems to be a lot
        of effort put into something silly is funny to me.
    </li>
    <li>
        I couldn't think of any more math examples off the top of my head but
        look at this artwork by Tomislav Jagnjic,
        <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/zKRBm">
            yo bro is it safe down there in the woods? yeah man it's cool
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>

    Such a cool book. Time travel, the fourth dimension, creepy children. It's
    creepy because,,, they seem like they're not even human anymore. That scene
    where the son looks at the beautiful valley and
    <span class="spoiler">says it's all wrong?</span>
    Chilling. It like the deer thing from tumblr, the distinctions between
    "never were," "are not anymore," and other types
    <a

        of monsters</a
    >.
</p>

<p>Keeping the extra-dimensional theme:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland">Flatland</a>, such a
        neat concept of a book. Satire, apparently. (I digress: go read
        <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm">
            A Modest Proposal
        </a>
        for a really funny piece of satire. Check out the wikipedia page for it
        if it's too boring or if you don't understand the lore.)
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://mashpoe.com/4d-miner">4d Miner</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/6Mx1G0RlYck">Hyperrouge</a>, a rougelike in
        hyperbolic space (non-euclidean)
    </li>
    <li>5d chess with multiverse time travel</li>
</ul>

    I don't know how this fits into this post's theme other than it just vibes
    right. Ha, radioactive cat songs. Classic.
</p>

<p>Farmer refuted is a pretty fun song. The rhythms playing into each other.</p>
