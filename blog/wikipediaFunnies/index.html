<p>I really need to automate a lot of this blog stuff.
I'm really interested in making the /blog page sortable somehow, as I get more blog posts. 
Gonna have to study up on javascript some more.
Sorting by length, by alphabetical, etc. I also want to be able to automatically generate the whole /blog page.
</p>

<p>hmm.</p>

<p>anyways, here are some wikipedia things i've found around that i think are neat.</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pitch drop experiement</a>,
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beverly Clock</a>, and
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Electric_Bell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxford Electric Bell</a>
	are cool. They've just been going on with ambient energy. I'm explaining that badly just go check them out.
  </li>
  <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demon core</a>. so many memes about this
  when it was trending online. "Under Slotin's own unapproved protocol, the shims were not used and the only thing preventing the closure was the blade of a standard flat-tipped screwdriver manipulated in Slotin's other hand."
  </li>
  <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant%27s_Foot_(Chernobyl)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elephant's Foot</a>
at Chernobyl. Man I guess radiation stuff is just interesting. Also: "able to be damaged by armor-piercing rounds fired from an AK-47 Kalashnikov rifle"
who was shooting it lmfao. this has done its rounds on social media too. that's usually where i get my interesting things
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cherenkov radiation</a> is apparently
  really hecking blue. Did you know screens really don't represent color well enough to tell a lot of things? Tom Scott tangent: 
  check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NzVmtbPOrM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I can't show you how pink this pink is.</a>
  there's a lot of other really interesting color drama with @color.nerd on tiktok, the memes about Anish Kapoor vs. Stuart Semple, color's just realy cool.
  </li>
  <li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ig Nobel Prize</a>
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Bad_Art" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Museum of Bad Art</a> are the 
  same genre of thing. (go read the Thefts section in the MOBA article). On the topic of things, here's another Tom Scott plug. I love that
  channel. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALy6e7GbDRQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,204,986 Votes Decided: What Is The Best Thing?</a>
