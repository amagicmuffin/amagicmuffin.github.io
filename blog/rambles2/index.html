<p>Psst too long? Read the second to last paragraph, it's filled with the real oranges I want to share with you</p>

<p>It's the end of senior year and for the first time in a long time, I've been able to indulge my interests so much slkdjf &lt;333</p>

<p>I've finished Hollow Knight (except for Path of Pain grrr) and I've started playing Celeste. I wish I could completely finish Hollow Knight but I'm too far into Celeste--only an hour into it and my HK muscle memory was gone :p. Now I'm on the final mega-screen/checkpoint of Celeste's final Farewell chapter and also playing modded on the side. </p>

<p>The mod that got me into modded is Strawberry Jam :3 God the Paint map is so pretty, and so many other ones. When playing modded Celeste, my main focus is playing pretty maps because I don't like the platforming enough to subject myself to hours of grinding a tech if I don't adore the scenery. I just want to smell the flowers slkdfj,,,</p>

<p>There's another really pretty map that I'm playing, the second advanced level map that I think I'll try to beat. It starts with a bunch of neutral jumps? The almost reminded me a lot of the game Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. And I love how the original game was about a girl climbing a mountain and how this map is so in line with that, how vertical the start was. And gosh the beautiful caverns-like background and the beautiful ambient music--that last one reminded me of Minecraft. Also like Minecraft, the sounds you get when you walk over land are so nice and soft, satifying clicks of stone or soft pats of moss lskdjfdl oh my sdfjlskdfjlkdjf. I spent a good minute or two of just walking around in this game meant to be a fast precision platformer. anyways, this is the map: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXm0cX-b2E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXm0cX-b2E</a> (donr remember the name)</p>

<p>Ughhh my wrists and fingers hurt. Carpal tunnel? I'll have to finish this up.</p>

<p>Old media from years back have resurfaced in my life. I've started replaying the Epic Battle Fantasy series starting with 3. Remember Animator vs. Animation? Jeez, the very first video came out 2007 and it's grown so much since then. I've just watched the first season of Animation v Minecraft. Please check out all of these if yall want a bunch of nostalgia.
