    wait wait hold on <a href="https://nier.fandom.com/">nier automata</a> is
    really cool lore :0. Here's a really nice summary of it in a reddit comment:
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/fr1nqv/comment/fltcpot/"
        >https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/fr1nqv/comment/fltcpot/</a
    >.
</p>

<p>occurred to me I might want to back up that reddit post. it'll be below.</p>

<p>
    they also have a really neat (spoiler)
    <span class="spoiler">"fuck it, soul linked plague"</span> gimmick that a
    really good webcomic,
    <a href="https://sssscomic.com/">stand still stay silent</a>
    uses.
</p>

<p><a href="https://soma.fandom.com/">SOMA</a> is also really cool :0</p>

<p>the nier thing:</p>

<p><span class="spoiler"> NieR Gestalt spoilers follow:</span></p>
<p>
    <span class="spoiler">
        Humans were going to go extinct due to a pandemic called White
        Chlorination Syndrome. In order to escape this, they developed a way of
        extracting the human soul from its physical form - called a Gestalt.
        They then developed Replicants that, through the Replicant System, would
        be 100% biologically identical to humans and continuously reborn by
        gathering data from the Gestalts. The plan was that after WCS had been
        eliminated, the Gestalts would reunite with their respective Replicants
        and become fully human again, thus saving the human race.</span
    >
</p>
<p>
    <span class="spoiler">
        Androids were developed before and alongside the Gestalt project to
        oversee the Replicants during the Gestalt project.</span
    >
</p>
<p>
    <span class="spoiler">
        Emil was originally a human child before the Gestalt Project went into
        full swing. He was part of a series of bio-weaponry experiments with the
        aim of fusing humans and magic to combat Legion (mindless thralls who
        had succumbed to WCS). The experiment resulted in his sister becoming
        the "ultimate weapon" and him gaining the ability of petrification in
        order to stop her after she went insane from losing her humanity. In
        NieR Gestalt, Emil is, speculatively, the last full "human" in existence
        even though the experiments had made him ageless and magic. Later he
        absorbs his sister's essence and becomes the Ultimate Weapon
        himself.</span
    >
</p>
<p>
    <span class="spoiler">
        In the end of NieR Gestalt, all of the Gestalts are doomed to perish
        from Relapse (going unstable) when Replicant NieR kills Gestalt NieR,
        because Gestalt NieR's Maso (Magic) was slowly "repairing" faltering
        Gestalts. With the Gestalts gone, the Replicants also begin to die out
        because the Replicant System doesnt work without Gestalts and Replicants
        cant reproduce normally. Humans go fully extinct.</span
    >
</p>
<p>
    <span class="spoiler">
        Years pass and the only intelligent beings on earth are Emil and
        Androids. Then aliens invade and Emil clones himself a bunch to create
        an army to fight them off. The Emil in NieR Automata is one of these
        clones, although the original Emil is supposedly still alive
        somewhere.</span
    >
</p>
<p>
    <span class="spoiler">
        Project YorHa was created by androids who had ultimately lost all
        purpose in life after humanity was doomed.</span
    >
</p>
<p>
    <span class="spoiler">
        The Machines were created by the aliens to fight the Androids and the
        Emils. Sapience was incepted into Machines (then called Machine
        Lifeforms) by a very old military robot nicknamed "Beepy" who developed
        sentience through unique social intereaction followed by an extremely
        long period of time in which his logic circuits could develop and
        process complex variable combinations. He then merged that processing
        power with every machine in an abandoned Military Compound, thus
        creating the first Machine Lifeform. Beepy then sent out a signal to all
        the mindless fighting machines, demanding that they should simply
        "live." Eventually this got through to them and they began developing
        their own complex logic and came to know sentience and "free will"
