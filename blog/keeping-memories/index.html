<p>
  It's so annoying to me that I forget things.
</p>

<p>
  I live my life, and there are events and accomplishments and things I do that
  I want to remember. A funny little joke I see somewhere on the internet, a
  really good book or movie or show that I've watched. But if I ever try to
  think back to the past, I know my memory passes over a lot of stuff that I'd
  rather not forget.
</p>

<p>
  I've been trying to record things that I want to remember, but that's even
  harder than just trying to remember in the first place (but maybe only because
  it's not really possible to *try* to remember). 
</p>

<p>
  My camera roll is filled with screenshots and photos and videos of the 
  memories that make up me. A screenie of the park map for Canobie, that one
  amusement park I went to during my Harvard pre-college program. The pretty
  sunsets and sunrises at the airports I've been visiting so much this summer,
  a video of me showing off a cool trick I did on roller blades taken with the
  phone propped up against a curb.
</p>

<p>
  I have a physical diary that I've been filling with thoughts, and my folder
  system on my laptop also holds things that I've doneâ€”scraps of code
  from various languages (I tried learning Rust a while ago), a .org file with
  videos and music and books that I've liked, images that I've saved for later.
</p>

<p>
  There's a picture frame on my bedroom wall with a collage of stuff I've
  collected from various places. Greeting cards are my favorite, they make them
  so prettily. I lost the one I got from Cornell, it was filled with stars and
  had a quote I can't remember. It must've been good, though. A piece of paper
  from the West Point gift shop, filled with seeds, made to be planted in the
  ground. Wildflowers. A texture almost like watercolor paper, so rough. It says
  "Constitution Island" on it, in a serif font. I love serif fonts, they're so
  pretty. A thing with bees and lavender flowers from Barnes n Nobles, a flower
  here and there highlighted with some gold colored film that reflects the light
  so nicely.
</p>

<p>
  This next part is something that I've seen said plenty of times now, but I'll
  say it again because it's important to me: it's so interesting that every
  single person, everyone I pass on the street or go to class with, is a human
  being with their own thoughts and memories. I don't think our brains are 
  really good at understanding that. It's pretty cool. Maybe this person here
  likes arranging flowers or this other one's been practicing HEMA for the past
  few years. You'd never know.
</p>

<p>
  I've always been bad at writing conclusions.
