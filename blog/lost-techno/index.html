    I had to hard reset my phone so I lost all non-backed up photos but I just
    realized that means I also lost selfies I took with a cosplay Technoblade :(
</p>

<p>
    I miss Techno, he's probably the only person I would be fine with watching
    youtube for. I don't really care about any other content creator's content,
    they're all not really as captivating? Not sure how to put it. Michael
    Reeves is pretty nice though, but that doesn't count because I'm moving the
    goalposts. Techno made probably the only vlogs I'll ever be excited to
    watch. Sad I won't get to see new ones.
</p>

<p>
    His visual persona is so cool as well, with so many fan fiction (text,
    image, animation, etc) made with it and others. Philza is cool too, crow god
    and all. Passerine is a good fanfiction. I printed out and hand bound it.
</p>

<p>
    The cosplayer had the techno dangling earring too. Darn. I should keep more
    regular backups or smth.
