I'm writing a lot today. I really need to spend less time on this so here's just a list of stuff about typography and other simple ui things I enjoy.
</p>

<p>
By the way. It seems like whenever I try to theme these blog posts, I get off my intended topic so uh. Enjoy my train of thought going all over the place. Hopefully it takes you some interesting places.

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solarized</a> a coloring theme. apparently a lot of effort was put into mathing it out to be pretty. That's cool.</li>
  <li><a href="http://iotic.com/averia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aver√≠a</a> a font. The guy averaged all the fonts in their computer together to make one font. Nerd. But it's really neat, the article is written really nicely; I love it when code stuff is explained so eloquently. The font turned out so prettily too, it's like a less psychic damaging version of comic sans. The website has a bunch of coding stuff on it. Just so much random stuff like a flute maker and visualizer, and a video camera warper, it really conjures up old internet vibes of finding random stuff littered around without the personality-killing polish that's on so many modern sites.</li>
  <li>Speaking of old internet, check out r/InternetIsBeautiful. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/kt8k5s/checkboxes_a_website_where_you_check_boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Checkboxes</a> is pretty interesting.</li>
  <li>Where was I? Typography and stuff. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/aarthificial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aarthificial</a>, he made his own <a href="https://youtu.be/WTUafAwrunE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animation engine</a> powered with code. (I think he said it was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3Blue1Brown</a>'s <a href="https://www.manim.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manim</a>?) So so cool. He uses it to make killer devlogs for his game, very understandable and pretty.</li>
  <li>There was a thing a while back where a company made a software that allegedly helps people read better by bolding the fronts of each word. And then sold it. And then got laughed and yelled at by people who know how tech works. This is a drastically oversimplified story that heavily opposes Bionic Reading's side, but whatever. Anyways, a bunch of people threw together <a href="https://not-br.neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps</a> in, like, a day to make it free.</li>
  <li>oo on the topic of cool web apps, check out <a href="https://zapquaker.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zapquaker</a> for Clash of Clans. I use it so often when I need to calculate exact levels.</li>
  <li>I'd be remiss if I didn't mention <a href="https://val-ritz.tumblr.com/post/186292923873/bouquetoftwelve-ommanyte-ommanyte-im-going" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Times New Bastard</a>.</li>
