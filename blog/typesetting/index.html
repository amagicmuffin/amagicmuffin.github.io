<p>
    Typst and Latex are pretty cool. This is about to get pretty technical,
    because I'm probably also going to use this to backup knowledge of how to
    repoduce my typsetting setup.
</p>

<p>
    I've been typesetting a lot lately for school and for fun. Latex is nice
    because it's been around for so long, so it's math typesetting, typesetting
    in general abilities are really guaranteed everywhere. If something doesn't
    work, you can hack it to work.
</p>

<p>
    The Tectonic typesetting project is also really cool. It made getting a
    latex compiler on a new machine so fast, no need to download a whole TexLive
    5gb package or whatever. I guess things like TinyTex exist but ehhh, I
    learned LaTex on texlive so I'm a bit averse to learning a different style
    of package management now. (TexLive's package management being: no need to,
    you've already installed the entire damn thing :p.) To get tectonic to play
    nice with Latex Workshop for VS Code, all you need is
</p>

<pre><code>
// for using vscode/latex workshop/tectonic together 
// this is the v1 code version https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/discussions/896#discussioncomment-2850685
"latex-workshop.latex.recipe.default": "tectonic",
"latex-workshop.latex.recipes": [
  {
    "name": "tectonic",
    "tools": ["tectonic"]
  }
],
"latex-workshop.latex.tools": [
  {
    "name": "tectonic",
    "command": "tectonic",
    "args": ["%DOC%.tex", "--keep-intermediates"],
    "env": {}
  }
],
</code></pre>

<p>
    in a settings.json. If tectonic ever finishes upgrading to v2, there's an
    updated solution in that same github link. But like this, I can preserve
    pdflatex/tectonic compile outputs. (ie, not need to have the default
    directory tree for tectonic v2).
</p>

<p>
    Though, I had to learn package managing anyways, in a way. I've kinda fallen
    in love with EB Garamond, and you can apparently get that font through
    LaTex.
</p>

<pre><code>
~$ wget https://tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/install-getnonfreefonts
~$ texlua install-getnonfreefonts
~$ getnonfreefonts garamond
</code></pre>

<p>
    I had some weird errors about texlua not having permissions to edit the
    /etc/... dir, and sudo texlua not being able to find texlua at all, but sudo
    su was a quick workaround that let everything run correctly.
</p>

<p>After that, any .tex document with</p>

<pre><code>
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[urw-garamond]{mathdesign}
\let\circledS\undefined
</code></pre>

<p>
    included is able to render the document in garamond. Undefining circledS has
    to be done because it urw-garamond sets it, which conflicts with amssymb.
    Amssym's looks much better. Unfortunately, it seems like tectonic won't be
    able to support this any time soon as per
    <a href="https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/issues/478">
        https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic/issues/478</a
    >. "OK, I've identified what's going on here. The TeXLive 2020 update won't
    help, unfortunately. In the standard TeXLive stack, the PDF generation
    process automatically generates a "PK" font file from the requested BBM
    font, by launching an external program mktexpk. Tectonic isn't in a position
    to do that, leading to the missing-font problem."
</p>

<p>
    I don't quite like how the numbers are rendered, though. The 0 character
    especially looks quite off, very wide. Not like EB Garamond that comes with
    google docs. Garamond-Math created at
    <a href="https://github.com/YuanshengZhao/Garamond-Math/">
        https://github.com/YuanshengZhao/Garamond-Math/
    </a>
    and

    </a>
    is absolutely beautiful, though. Check out those sample fonts! Mwah.
</p>

<p>
    Note to self: i should probably make a blog post doubling as an archive for
    my dotfile/home folder structure and all.
