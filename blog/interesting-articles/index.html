    This'll be a list of more full-length articles I've thought were
    interesting. At some point, I'll find a way to "pin" this to the top.

    The discussion section is pretty interesting here. On the topic of xkcd,
    check out the explainxkcd on the "Time" and "Click and Drag" strips. I use
