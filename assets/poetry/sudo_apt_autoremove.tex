\censor{and it was you, over and over again} is here again. They sit you down and they have sat down, a briefcase unfastened.

\begin{dialogue}{\censor{and it was you, over and over again}}
    Hello.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{You}
    It is this time again.
\end{dialogue}

\begin{dialogue}{\censor{and it was you, over and over again}}
    I come to sit you down and have a serious conversation, yes. But it is different from the others, because it is the last.
\end{dialogue}

Papers are now coming out of the briefcase, neat rows of serif between company coat of arms. 

The string lights against homegrown fir are too pretty this time of year. You wish this were happening any other day---yesterday was plenty cloudy, yesterday would've been fine.

\begin{dialogue}{\censor{and it was you, over and over again}}
    Observe section one. No one remains, for you. Everyone else has left, and forgotten you, and this means you are useless. You will die now, and there will be no change in the world but a imperceptible increase in the free space available for the rest of us to walk. No one will notice your death. This is just a formality, the one we agreed on that very first day, where we said your worth is measured by what you can do for others, and it is not enough now, so you were turned away from until, and I cannot stress this enough, you are worth nothing.
\end{dialogue}

and then you died
and you heard the sound of bells
and then you died
and your tinnitus is the sound of you screaming competition against a tea kettle until your lungs are wrinkled like a paper bag you crumpled up and threw away
and then you died
and you stand there alone but quiet and quite peaceful actually as nothing moves because it is an hour before midnight and this is early in the night, yes, but not enough for the sleepy town
and then you died
and you are so tired and you have a phone call you must make that you didn't get to which is so aggravating having unfinished business isn't it
and then you died
and it is so aggravating having unfinished business isn't it
and then you died
and you had so many things you wanted to do with them but you didn't realize they left
and then you died
and then you died

\centretitle{Epilogue}
Make sure you're seated upright in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor. Try to be in a stress-free, quiet environment where you can focus on your breathing.

Keep your hands relaxed in your lap, palms facing up, and focus on your posture. Sit up straight, which will help you take deep breaths.

When you're ready, start:

Sitting upright, slowly exhale through your mouth, releasing all the oxygen from your lungs. Focus on this intention and be conscious of what you're doing.

Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose to the count of four. In this step, count to four very slowly in your head.

Feel the air fill your lungs, one section at a time, until your lungs are full and the air moves into your abdomen.

Hold your breath for another slow count of four.

Exhale through your mouth for the same slow count of four, expelling the air from your lungs and abdomen.

Be conscious of the feeling of the air leaving your lungs.

Hold your breath for the same slow count of four before repeating this process.

Alright.

I'm not sure that helped, really. I'm still sure the world is ending and I am feeling very sad about it.
