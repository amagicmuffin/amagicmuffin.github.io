<p>I use latex a looot now because of university. Tangent: it feels so weird to be the person now, saying "because
of university." It's not too long ago that I was the young high schooler looking at those OLD PEOPLE at afar. anyways,</p>

<p>Latex is cool i guess. I managed to get anki (the flash carding program, not the weird cable television-advertised 
hotwheels ripoff(?)) working with latex which is pretty cool, I can study all my fancy formulas with anki and 
spaced repetition now. Though, for some reason the font rendering is so ugly compared to normal latex i think.
Not sure if this is a dvipng (program used to render the images for latex to anki, i think) issue or just me
getting placebo effected from the font just being larger.</p>

<p>Early into the semester, I wrote this gem with latex: <a href="./lady_tigers_unsolved.pdf">./lady_tigers_unsolved.pdf</a></p></p>

<p>I forgot to mention that the end goal was to find where the lady was. Whoops, mb</p>

<p>A friend recommended The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us! by Sufjan Stevens. It's really good.</p>
