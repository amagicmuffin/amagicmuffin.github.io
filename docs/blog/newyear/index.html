<p>Welcome to the new year I guess!</p>

<p>Plenty of sitewide changes to move things off third party hosting (hedgehog in /stuff.html), update /stuff buttons, improve readability, etc.</p>

<p>On the topic of readability, I've always really liked clean websites instead of the wacky massive modern stuff. <a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2020/11/23/website-best-practices/">Seirdy's post</a>
about this and <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/</a> are both super helpful and really interesting reads.
Well, maybe that's misleading. I like websites that have a personal charm to them and modern ones often don't. Clean websites are amazing but so is 
absolute tomfoolery like <a href="https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/pepsi-1996">the one Pepsi used to have</a>.</p>

<p>On the topic of reading things, holy hell there is a lot of that to be done in college. Most of the readings I've had this year, both for humanities and
    STEM have been pretty engaging though, so I'm very thankful for that. I also dug out some of my old readings from 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_English_Language_and_Composition">AP Lang</a> back in the day. Here is a tiny selection of some I found that I
    thought were really interesting:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/how-to-predict-the-future/588040/">The Peculiar Blindness of Experts</a>. "Credentialed authorities are comically bad at predicting the future. But reliable forecasting is possible." </li>
    <li><a href="https://theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/">The Disadvantages of an Elite Education</a>. "Our best universities have forgotten that the reason they exist is to make minds, not careers"</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm">A Modest Proposal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Went to Arizona and found Numb by Linkin Park on some alt radio station</p>
