<p>oooo dithering ooooo! it makes things look really pretty. I think i have a laptop sticker somewhere that's dithered clouds or something and it 
looks real nice. Check out this tool for dithering: <a href="https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/">https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/</a>.
Ordered dithering with mat height 2 or 4 looks great. the Commodore pallet is great. b and w is fine.</p>

<p>Also aoe2 is really funny for having a <a href="https://ageofempires.fandom.com/wiki/Taunt">soundboard</a> with taunts that get played globally when you 
type in numbers. I've been using number 7 "aaaaaaa." pretty often. In a game once where I did something stupid with monks, the enemy team 
bm'd me with "What is your strategy?" "Attack the enemy with monks." Had me on the floor.</p>

<p>Some honorable mentions are dadgum (sounds like "Dad? Gone!") and the iconic wololo.</p>

<p><a href="https://idialedyournumber.bandcamp.com/album/hourglass">idialedyournumber</a> sounds really nice. Found them from Bunny Goes 2 Business School on youtube.</p>
