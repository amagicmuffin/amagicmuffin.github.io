<p>I feel like I have to archive things to keep them safe.</p>

<p>Because memory is always fallible and I want to know all the little things that I think or once thought were important! So I make notes, I write text files and org documents and blog posts and put buttons on my /stuff wall.</p>

<p>Of course, this means link rot makes me sad :(. https://sus.omg.lol/ from that wall is no longer available already. I should go screenshot just their homepages or something and back them up on this site. Archiving.</p>

<p>On the topic of link rot, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Million_Dollar_Homepage>the Million Dollar Homepage</a> is pretty cool.

<p>I'm literally sitting in a lecture and i got homework i should be doing in class instead of blogging so I think i'll end it here. Music rec time :3</a>

<p>I went to a wind ensemble performance and oh man it was so pretty. I can really understand why people believe in god. When the band starts raining music theory, it really does feel like the angels are descending. The venue was really pretty, too--almost church-like, and the lighting poking out through myriad fixtures in the ceiling. Angels. Heaven. What imagery.</p>

<p>They played Wine Dark Sea. It and its second movement spinoff This Cruel Moon by Mackey are really, really good. Hymn to a Blue Hour and Sheltering Sky by John Mackey (memories from my high school band repertoire) are also both pretty good.</p>
