    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meta" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meta</a>, meaning something like "about itself," is a word with cool implications. I love music videos that are "meta." Since they're pieces of media consumed in such a tech heavy world, it's so neat seeing pieces of tech that we recognize being put into them. It's so cool stylistically, something like editing a blinking cursor is extra work but its something that adds to the Experience.

    tw: This song's title and lyrics revolve around <span class="spoiler">suicide</span>. Avoid if bad. It's so cool though. It's set up as if the entire video was animated in ASCII with a code script, and at one point a cursor brings in a circular color pallet thing in and starts changing the colors. I wonder if that was coded in too, or if the producer actually recorded someone manually clicking those, or if the entire video was animated and there actually wasn't a code thing going on.

    This one's so charming. I love paper annotations, and there was that one time text was selected and deleted as if with a text editor. I love the font and those angled drawing all with the same line width.

    The list goes on and on and on, these are just the ones that I found today and decided to hyperfixate on. I should be doing homework (:

    Anyways, I think putting references to technology in any media is cool. I never got into watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilbur_Soot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wilbur Soot</a> stream, but I loved that his stream was Windows 95 themed.

    Also, I just realized that the code I use to generate these blog pages broke. So uh. Hm. That's a problem for later I have other more importnat things to do.
    </p>

    edit: thats really weird. The code looks like it's working now. Testtest. Hmm. Whatever.

    Anyways, I forgot to include what song was on my mind. I've been loving Saint Bernard by Lincoln lately. In a few days my english teacher is having us bring in song lyrics to start off poetry unit and I think I'll bring that. It's got some cool stuff to analyse I think, like how there are motifs of dog and Jesus and "Saint Bernard" merges those two, being a Saint like from the Bible and also a breed of dog.
