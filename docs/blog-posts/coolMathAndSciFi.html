    I'm kinda worried that I'm writing too many bits to my hard disk, I don't want to wear it out too soon. I've programmed a thing to generate these pages for me, but right now it rewrites every single page in the website. So. Hopefully soon, I'll probably try to update it so that I can specify which file I want to update. Shooouldn't be incredibly hard.

    Anyways, I want to talk about cool math and sci-fi themed stuff today.

    I find the concept of obscure and seemingly random math things really funny. Like, I understand that this probably has some important application but. It's just funny to me, the image I have in my head of a bunch of esteemed mathematicians getting together, all formal-like, to just invert a sphere. Some other funny things from this genre of random math stuff are: 
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy_ball_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the hairy ball theorem</a></li>
      <li>ok I just realized that all kinds of media where there seems to be a lot of effort put into something silly is funny to me.</li>
      <li>I couldn't think of any more math examples off the top of my head but look at this artwork by Tomislav Jagnjic, <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/zKRBm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yo bro is it safe down there in the woods? yeah man it's cool</a></li>
    </ul>

    Such a cool book. Time travel, the fourth dimension, creepy children. It's creepy because,,, they seem like they're not even human anymore. That scene where the son looks at the beautiful valley and <span class="spoiler">says it's all wrong?</span> Chilling. It like the deer thing from tumblr, the distinctions between "never were," "are not anymore," and other types <a href="https://gallusrostromegalus.tumblr.com/post/170953901583/most-definitely-human-brunhiddensmusings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of monsters</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Keeping the extra-dimensional theme:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flatland</a>, such a neat concept of a book. Satire, apparently. (I digress: go read <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Modest Proposal</a> for a really funny piece of satire. Check out the wikipedia page for it if it's too boring or if you don't understand the lore.)</li>
      <li><a href="https://mashpoe.com/4d-miner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4d Miner</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://youtu.be/6Mx1G0RlYck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperrouge</a>, a rougelike in hyperbolic space (non-euclidean)</li>
      <li>5d chess with multiverse time travel</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    I don't know how this fits into this post's theme other than it just vibes right. Ha, radioactive cat songs. Classic.

    Farmer refuted is a pretty fun song. The rhythms playing into each other.
