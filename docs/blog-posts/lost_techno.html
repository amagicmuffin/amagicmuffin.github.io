    <p>I had to hard reset my phone so I lost all non-backed up photos but I just realized that means I also lost
        selfies I took with a cosplay Technoblade :(</p>
    
    <p>
        I miss Techno, he's probably the only person I would be fine with watching youtube for. I don't really
        care about any other content creator's content, they're all not really as captivating? Not sure how 
        to put it. Michael Reeves is pretty nice though, but that doesn't count because I'm moving the goalposts.
        Techno made probably the only vlogs I'll ever be excited to watch. Sad I won't get to see new ones.

        His visual persona is so cool as well, with so many fan fiction (text, image, animation, etc) made with it and others.
        Philza is cool too, crow god and all. Passerine is a good fanfiction. I printed out and hand bound it.

        The cosplayer had the techno dangling earring too. Darn. I should keep more regular backups or smth.
