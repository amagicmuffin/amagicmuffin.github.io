      It's so annoying to me that I forget things.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I live my life, and there are events and accomplishments and things I do that
      I want to remember. A funny little joke I see somewhere on the internet, a
      really good book or movie or show that I've watched. But if I ever try to
      think back to the past, I know my memory passes over a lot of stuff that I'd
      rather not forget.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I've been trying to record things that I want to remember, but that's even
      harder than just trying to remember in the first place (but maybe only because
      it's not really possible to *try* to remember). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My camera roll is filled with screenshots and photos and videos of the 
      memories that make up me. A screenie of the park map for Canobie, that one
      amusement park I went to during my Harvard pre-college program. The pretty
      sunsets and sunrises at the airports I've been visiting so much this summer,
      a video of me showing off a cool trick I did on roller blades taken with the
      phone propped up against a curb.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have a physical diary that I've been filling with thoughts, and my folder
      system on my laptop also holds things that I've doneâ€”scraps of code
      from various languages (I tried learning Rust a while ago), a .org file with
      videos and music and books that I've liked, images that I've saved for later.
    </p>

      There's a picture frame on my bedroom wall with a collage of stuff I've
      collected from various places. Greeting cards are my favorite, they make them
      so prettily. I lost the one I got from Cornell, it was filled with stars and
      had a quote I can't remember. It must've been good, though. A piece of paper
      from the West Point gift shop, filled with seeds, made to be planted in the
      ground. Wildflowers. A texture almost like watercolor paper, so rough. It says
      "Constitution Island" on it, in a serif font. I love serif fonts, they're so
      pretty. A thing with bees and lavender flowers from Barnes n Nobles, a flower
      here and there highlighted with some gold colored film that reflects the light
      so nicely.

      This next part is something that I've seen said plenty of times now, but I'll
      say it again because it's important to me: it's so interesting that every
      single person, everyone I pass on the street or go to class with, is a human
      being with their own thoughts and memories. I don't think our brains are 
      really good at understanding that. It's pretty cool. Maybe this person here
      likes arranging flowers or this other one's been practicing HEMA for the past
      few years. You'd never know.

      I've always been bad at writing conclusions.
