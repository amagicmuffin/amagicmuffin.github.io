      Is this page <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built to last</a>?
    </p>

      I don't know. I have a nostalgia for old things but i dont know how long ill keep this website
      up myself. maybe the is-a.dev service goes down. Maybe github pages does somehow.
    </p>

      I don't know what I wanted to talk about, I just thought Huang's post was interesting.

      related: sometimes i'll suddenly worry for some reason "oh no what if github loses my
      website somehow? D:" because i have a distrust of cloud services partly because that's
      just more steps to go through, more points of faliure for data to get lost. and also
      because if i mess something up myself lol. but because of how git works everything's just
      on my local computer anyways :D
    <p>
      i like Obedient by drain gang on youtube, wonder what genre that is. love songs 
      with complex background music, esp if it has sixteenth notes
