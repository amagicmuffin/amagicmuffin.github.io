    <p>GOD FUCKING DAMMIT (sic) (this is a rant transcribed from a group chat lol. i feel very strongly about this. &gt;:( )</p>

    <p>ms paint now is also implementing whatever shitty zoom function that every other art program under this godforsaken sun uses
    that makes unaliased pixel pens look like fucking shit if it isn't being used at exactly 100% zoom <br> before, ms paint was constrained to zooms of n &isin; â„¤, 2^n <br> which was one reason why it helped not suck <br> but even those have these shitty aliasing things turned on now</p>

    <p>and other programs might even have weird whatever nearest neighbor algorithms they use that makes lines drawn even at 100% zoom look FUCKING WEIRD
    oh wait nvm that one was just unclear about what 100% zoom was it looks fine zoomed in<br>
    (which is part of the problem)<br>
    wait wtf no 400% was fine but 100% looked ugly how tf does that even work</p>
    
    <p>End rant. You can tell I've started using Latex lol. College woohoo! I got wsl and am a lot more familiar with vim and the linux terminal, it's been really really cool.</p>
    
    <p>I miss this blog, it's kinda like another home.</p>
    
    <p>god, getting this to uploaded to github may or may not be a pain in about two minutes now.</p>
    
    <p>Been really really into the artists Everybody's Worried About Owen and Novo Amor lately.</p>
