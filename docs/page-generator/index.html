<p>Heyo, it's amagicmuffin. Welcome to my little corner of the internet ^^</p>

<h2>who?</h2>

<p>Yeah I'm not really sure either. But I like to code. I mainly use Python and Javaâ€”I like Python for little
  gui or automation scripts and Java for more complicated console applications, but that'll probably change.
  I'd like to figure out Maven for Java to get working with more practical applications outside of the
  terminal without needing to manually deal with dependencies, and I'd like to learn how to build larger
  applications with Python. Pygame sounds cool.</p>

<h2>asked?</h2>

<p>aw man</p>
