<p>Heyo, it's amagicmuffin. Welcome to my little corner of the internet ^^</p>

<h2>who?</h2>

<p>Yeah I'm still figuring that one out.</p>

<p>I always have trouble writing bios because my interests change so often. 
My current ones are (as of the last time I updated this, Aug 2022) 
coding, inline skating (I just figured out how to soul slide! :D), and 
(unfortunately) figuring out college essays.

<h2>asked?</h2>
