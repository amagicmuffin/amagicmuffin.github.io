<h1>blog</h1>

<p>Ok this site is very work-in-progress right now so I'll just slap some ramblings here as a TODO.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have a list of interests in interests, but since theres a bunch of unorganized shenanigans going on my brain, put things that should be mentioned but aren't important enough to get their own item in interests into a blog post.</li>
  <li>Get the quote in home page working</li>
  <li>have max crop width be width of photo. get it pixel perfect just cause. </li>
</ul>

<pre>
  <code>/** testing out code block css */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(&quotHeyo world <3&quot);
					 }
					 </code>
</pre>
