        I love this project so much. I put my heart and soul into making this so clean and readable. I know it's simple but it's still the culmination of so many different things I've learned and memories I've gone through. &lt;3

        I got tired of hitting "next chapter" every time I finished reading a litchart page. So I built a thing that put
        all the summaries on one single page. Loads fast, too, since it's just plain html. You can take a look at what it
        generated for the book <i>How to Read Literature Like a Professor</i> (my summer homework)

        Yeah alright I gotta learn how to generate a blog/website with emacs. It's way too much of a hassle going around like a court fool generating files by hand. So I guess that's on the bucket list.
