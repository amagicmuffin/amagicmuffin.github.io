    <p>I dislike the mortifying ordeal of not being known. And so I write poetry and so I write blog posts :3</p>
    
    <p>These aren't dated but should be ordered most recent towards the top, as I add them.</p>

        I joined a student poetry class at school! More poetry to probably come, then. Here's one I wrote
        about feelings on the death of the author: sometimes it's bad (but other times it's like the woah! two cakes! meme, and good).
