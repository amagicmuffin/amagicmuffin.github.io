    <a href="blog-posts/keepingMemories.html">Blog 001: keeping memories</a>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Have a list of interests in interests, but since theres a bunch of unorganized shenanigans going on my brain, put things that should be mentioned but aren't important enough to get their own item in interests into a blog post.</li>
      <li>Get the quote in home page working</li>
      <li>have max crop width be width of photo. get it pixel perfect just cause. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <pre>
      <code>/** testing out code block css */
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(&quotHeyo world <3&quot);
    					 }
