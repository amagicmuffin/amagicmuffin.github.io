description: I share some links for what I use for bookbinding. I explain my interest about conversation and "textbooks" for it I have found. I think about future site expansion.

<ul>

        I first learned how to bookbind from this wonderful YouTube video by
        Jess Less:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3jae1cuvSo">
            Turning Fanfiction Into the Hardcover Book it Deserves
        </a>
        .
    </li>
    <li>
        This
        <a href="https://www.bookbindingworkshopsg.com/pdf-to-book-printing/">
            blog post
        </a>
        has a list of really good pdf-to-book-format converters. (because if you
        think about how a book is bound, with multiple sets of paper
        ("signatures"), it doesn't make sense to just take a book pdf as-is and
        just print that). Jess used Adobe Acrobat, but I hate that software, so
        slow to load D: I now use
        <a href="https://momijizukamori.github.io/bookbinder-js">
            bookbinder-js
        </a>
        . Careful, doesn't seem to download output files on Firefox! :0
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://pagedjs.org/about/">pagedjs.org</a>
        is a... uh... "JavaScript library that paginates content in the browser
        to create PDF output from any HTML content. This means you can design
        works for print (eg. books) using HTML and CSS!" Yeah, that. I was
        googling for bookbinder-js because I didn't want to endorse Adobe
        Acrobat, but found this on the way.

</ul>

    Topic switch: I have a friend who's really into meta conversation (i.e. they
    converse about conversation often (isn't meta a fun word and concept? see:
    wikipedia or stackoverflow meta pages)). They make me want to be better at
    conversing. So, I found this
    <a
        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/buk459/my_list_of_the_35_best_social_skills_books_i/"
    >
        reddit post
    </a>
    aggregating some apparently good books on the topic. In that post is this
    other
    <a href="https://socialself.com/blog/books-making-conversation/">
        blog post
    </a>
    from socialself.com that has another list. I've been looking at that second
    list. In particular, Conversationally Speaking by Alan Garner is REALLY
    GOOD! It reads like a textbook, so I'm right at home. socialself's blog post
    ITSELF is also really really good. Each book on the list is accompanied by a
    summary of its contents and themes that might draw you to or turn you away
    from a book.
</p>

<p>
    On top of Conversationally Speaking (
    <code>ISBN-10 9781565656291</code>
    ), I'll hopefully be looking into these:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        How to speak, how to listen (
        <code>ISBN-10 9780684846477</code>
        )
    </li>
    <li>
        The fine art of small talk: how to start a conversation in any situation
        (
        <code>ISBN-10 1401302262</code>
        )
    </li>
    <li>
        power questions build relationships, win new business, and influence
        others (
        <code>ISBN-10 1118119630</code>
        )
    </li>
    <li>
        If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look on My Face? (
        <code>ISBN-10 9780812989151</code>
        )
    </li>
</ul>

<p>2007 Called, They Want Their Jeans Back is really fun and emoish.</p>
