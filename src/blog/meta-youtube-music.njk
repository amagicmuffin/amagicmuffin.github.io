    <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meta">meta</a>,
    meaning something like "about itself," is a word with cool implications. I
    love music videos that are "meta." Since they're pieces of media consumed in
    such a tech heavy world, it's so neat seeing pieces of tech that we
    recognize being put into them. It's so cool stylistically, something like
    editing a blinking cursor is extra work but its something that adds to the
    Experience.

    <a href="https://youtu.be/giQs3jIQYlk">

    </a>
    <br />
    tw: This song's title and lyrics revolve around
    <span class="spoiler">suicide</span>
    . Avoid if bad. It's so cool though. It's set up as if the entire video was
    animated in ASCII with a code script, and at one point a cursor brings in a
    circular color pallet thing in and starts changing the colors. I wonder if
    that was coded in too, or if the producer actually recorded someone manually
    clicking those, or if the entire video was animated and there actually
    wasn't a code thing going on.

    This one's so charming. I love paper annotations, and there was that one
    time text was selected and deleted as if with a text editor. I love the font
    and those angled drawing all with the same line width.

    WOAHHH THIS ONES SO COOL
</p>

<p>
    The list goes on and on and on, these are just the ones that I found today
    and decided to hyperfixate on. I should be doing homework (:
</p>

<p>
    Anyways, I think putting references to technology in any media is cool. I
    never got into watching
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilbur_Soot">Wilbur Soot</a>
    stream, but I loved that his stream was Windows 95 themed.
</p>

<p>
    Also, I just realized that the code I use to generate these blog pages
    broke. So uh. Hm. That's a problem for later I have other more importnat
    things to do.
</p>

<p>
    edit: thats really weird. The code looks like it's working now. Testtest.
    Hmm. Whatever.
</p>

<p>
    Anyways, I forgot to include what song was on my mind. I've been loving
    Saint Bernard by Lincoln lately. In a few days my english teacher is having
    us bring in song lyrics to start off poetry unit and I think I'll bring
    that. It's got some cool stuff to analyse I think, like how there are motifs
    of dog and Jesus and "Saint Bernard" merges those two, being a Saint like
    from the Bible and also a breed of dog.
