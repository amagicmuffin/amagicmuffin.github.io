<p>Welcome to the new year I guess!</p>

<p>
    Plenty of sitewide changes to move things off third party hosting (hedgehog
    in /stuff.html), update /stuff buttons, improve readability, etc.
</p>

<p>
    On the topic of readability, I've always really liked clean websites instead
    of the wacky massive modern stuff.

    about this and

    </a>
    are both super helpful and really interesting reads. Well, maybe that's
    misleading. I like websites that have a personal charm to them and modern
    ones often don't. Clean websites are amazing but so is absolute tomfoolery
    like

    On the topic of reading things, holy hell there is a lot of that to be done
    in college. Most of the readings I've had this year, both for humanities and
    STEM have been pretty engaging though, so I'm very thankful for that. I also
    dug out some of my old readings from
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_English_Language_and_Composition">
        AP Lang
    </a>
    back in the day. Here is a tiny selection of some I found that I thought
    were really interesting:

        . "Credentialed authorities are comically bad at predicting the future.
        But reliable forecasting is possible."

        make minds, not careers"

</ul>

<p>Went to Arizona and found Numb by Linkin Park on some alt radio station</p>
