<p>
    I've been taking looks at NixOS, and it's real cool. I've been using the
    <code>uv</code> python project/package manager recently, as well as being
    exposed to stuff like <code>npm</code>. These have declarative environments
    (<code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>package.json</code>) that makes
    coding in different places a treat.
</p>

<p>
    In general, being able to set-and-forget a configuration for something is
    really really comforting. My current setup runs an Ubuntu LTS with so many
    mods that getting them all back after a system reset or new install or Bad
    Thing happening would take up all those hours and hours of googling again.
</p>

<p>
    I'd like to learn NixOS and solve this problem, but apparently it still has
    its compatibility problems of its own.
    <code>uv</code> itself is terribly painful, it seems, and python isn't much
    better if at all. Anyways, here's a list of links I've found on NixOS.
