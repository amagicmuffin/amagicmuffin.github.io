<p>
    note to self: can install an up-to-date version of R from posit's cdn, of
    all places:
    <a href="https://docs.posit.co/resources/install-r.html"
        >https://docs.posit.co/resources/install-r.html</a
    >

    update: make sure you grab the correct versions! I use Ubuntu 22, and tried
    to install for Ubuntu 24, which gave a scary unfixable error message:
