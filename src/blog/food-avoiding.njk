    I really need to keep a list of foods I should never buy again when I
    encounter them in the wrong scenarios. Tangentially, I should start making a
    digital garden to complement one-off blog posts. I've heard "digital garden"
    described as a website style where you cultivate a garden of continually
    changing pages instead of releasing things post by post.
</p>

<p>
    For example, this list of foods would make more sense as a garden plot
    instead of being in the blog section. Hmm, I'll make a new page or section
    for a garden soon I think.
</p>

<p>Anyways, here's my current list to myself:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        ramen: I swear, this is always so mid. It's alright, but like, it's
        always JUST noodles. I could make this at home. Don't waste your money.
    </li>
    <li>
        double scoop of ice cream: TOO MUCH ICE CREAM! YEOWCH! This extends to
        all things that you think might be too much sweet. Ice cream floats are
        delish though.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Tears Over Beers by Modern Baseball is heartachey. Most of midwest emo is
    nice in that way.
