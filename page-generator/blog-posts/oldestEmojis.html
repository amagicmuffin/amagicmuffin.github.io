    emojis really are something.
</p>

<p>
    apparently CMU has the claim for the very first smiley face emoticon, and the forum thread that spawned it was
    really funny. you should read <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/sefSmiley.htm">this</a> and especially
    <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/Orig-Smiley.htm">this</a>.
</p>

<p>on top of that, the earliest emoji sets were really charming. 
    <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/correcting-the-record-on-the-first-emoji-set/">here</a>'s a pretty cool
    blog post that includes some of the oldest ones. Also check out 
    <a href="https://emojipedia.org/softbank/1997">https://emojipedia.org/softbank/1997</a> and
    <a href="https://emojipedia.org/docomo/1999">https://emojipedia.org/docomo/1999</a> for some really old emoji sets
    that were mentioned. Again, old things are cool.

    Line without a Hook by Ricky Montgomery has been stuck in my head for a bit. 
    That <a href="https://youtu.be/5E0asEhH2Dw">one cover</a> to Red Room Valentine is still pretty good.
