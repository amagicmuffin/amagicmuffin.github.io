  Is this page <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">built to last</a>?
</p>

<p>
  I don't know. I have a nostalgia for old things but i dont know how long ill keep this website
  up myself. maybe the is-a.dev service goes down. Maybe github pages does somehow.

<p>
  I don't know what I wanted to talk about, I just thought Huang's post was interesting.

  related: sometimes i'll suddenly worry for some reason "oh no what if github loses my
  website somehow? D:" because i have a distrust of cloud services partly because that's
  just more steps to go through, more points of faliure for data to get lost. and also
  because if i mess something up myself lol. but because of how git works everything's just
  on my local computer anyways :D
<p>
  i like Obedient by drain gang on youtube, wonder what genre that is. love songs 
  with complex background music, esp if it has sixteenth notes
